### Definitions
He defined machine learning as the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
### Machine Learning algorithms
- Supervised learning
- Unsupervised learning
- Recommender systems
- Reinforcement learning

The other thing we're going to spend a lot of time on in this specialization is practical advice for applying learning algorithms. 

### Supervised Learning - 99%
Supervised machine learning or more commonly, supervised learning, refers to algorithms that learn x to y or input to output mappings.

The key characteristic of supervised learning is that you give your learning algorithm examples to learn from.

That includes the right answers, whereby right answer, I mean, the correct label y for a given input x, and is by seeing correct pairs of input x and desired output label y that the learning algorithm eventually learns to take just the input alone without the output label and gives 
a reasonably accurate prediction or guess of the output.

f(x) = y 에서 올바른 (x,y)로 모델 학습 =>  x  입력 -> y 출력
